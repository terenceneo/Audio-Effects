# Audio Effects
DJ sound mixer that is able to create remixes of voices, sounds and melodies
- Signal manipulation for real time audio pitch shifting and sound delay
- Through signal analysis, successfully implemented noise filter and sound merging functions

### Basic Features
- Real-time microphone-speaker system
- Microphone-speaker system that delays the sound output by 1s
- Piano player using switches
- Volume adjustment in piano mode (indicated with 7-segment)
- Octave adjustment in piano mode (indicated with 7-segment)

### Cool Features
- Microphone-speaker system with user adjustable sound delays and pitch levels (delays and pitch can be controlled with the joystick and current setting displayed on 7-segment)
- Recording mode with sound signals stored in a round buffer
- User adjustable duration and pitch of recorded sound eg. A 1s recorded sound clip can be dragged to play in a 2s duration while maintaining the same pitch (:tada: What scocery is that :tada:)
- Multiple switches can be pressed simultaneously in piano mode to play chords!!!
- LED ripple effect and LED shift when switches or buttons are toggled

### Super Cool Features
- Noise filtering mode which filters away unwanted background noises for clear and crisp voice sound (that doesnâ€™t hurt your ears, how useful and user-friendly is that!)
_(Noise cancellation is not required for Musical Instrument modes and disabled during Sound Merging)_
- Simultaneous playback of an unlimited number of sounds created by the various features above when the various switches are toggled on at the same time
- **Bonus: timing, pitch, octave etc. adjustments can be done during sound merging**
