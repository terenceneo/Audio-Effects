WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPIR-1) Asynchronous driver check - DSP time_delay input pin time_delay/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP time_delay output time_delay/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net delayedpitch1/clkx_adjuster/clk_write_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin delayedpitch1/clkx_adjuster/clk_write_reg_i_1/O, cell delayedpitch1/clkx_adjuster/clk_write_reg_i_1.
